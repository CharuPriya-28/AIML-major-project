## TO DO 

ðŸš€Major Project â€“ Income prediction from adult.csv file

1. Split dataset with 8:2 ratio for train and test sets

2. Apply SVM, Random forest and Logistic regression for building model (use X_train, Y-train)

3. Test the models one by one on unseen data (X_test)

4. Display accuracy score, classification report and confusion matrix for each of models

5. Plot the comparison of the accuracies as a bar chart

6. Plot confusion matrix as heatmap for each model

7. Apply randomised grid search to tune the hyper parameters

8. Predict and display the income for a single input from the dataset resembling the working of an AI system
